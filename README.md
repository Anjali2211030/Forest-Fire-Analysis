This project aims to leverage various regression and classification techniques to predict and mitigate the occurrence of forest fires in this beautiful natural reserve. 
Montesinho National Park, located in northeastern Portugal, is known for its rich biodiversity and stunning landscapes. However, like many forested areas, it faces the threat of wildfires, which can have devastating ecological and economic consequences. Predicting the occurrence and behavior of these fires is crucial for effective fire management and prevention efforts.
The Objective of the study is to:
* Develop predictive models to forecast the likelihood and severity of forest fires in Montesinho National Park.
* Explore various regression techniques to predict the spatial extent and intensity of fires.
* Utilize classification algorithms to classify areas at risk of ignition and spread of fires.
* Provide insights to stakeholders and decision-makers for implementing proactive measures to prevent and control forest fires.

The dataset used in this project contains historical records of forest fires in Montesinho National Park, including spatial and temporal attributes such as weather conditions, topography, and land cover types. This data will serve as the foundation for training and evaluating our predictive models.
We will employ a combination of regression and classification techniques, including but not limited to:

* Linear Regression
* Random Forest Regression
* Support Vector Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees
* Random Forest Classification
